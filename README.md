# IBM VISUAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM
This is a project based on IBM services which are available free of cost to everyone.
The main aim of this project is to make people understand how accurate and helpful can machine learning be, and also, how easy it is to make a machine learning model without writing a single line of code.
The Ibm visual recognition service allows you to upload images and make predefined classes for developing supervised machine learning algorithms.
Once, the model has been trained with a given dataset, it is ready to be used and tested.
You can now upload the images and it will tell you which category from the given datset, the new image fits best with confidence scored lying from 0-1.

Here is a video demonstration of my Project, Please Have a Look for Better Understanding
